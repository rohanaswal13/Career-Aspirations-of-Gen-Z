# Career-Aspirations-of-Gen-Z
The Excel dashboards provide an interactive visualization of survey data related to career aspirations and employer preferences, offering insights into what Gen Z values in their professional journeys. The project involved data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to present key trends, such as preferred industries, work-life balance expectations, salary aspirations, and factors influencing job selection. Despite being functional, the initial dashboards lacked visual appeal, leading to an iterative improvement process.
